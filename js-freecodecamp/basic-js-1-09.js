/* 
    Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScriptPassed
    We can also subtract one number from another.

    JavaScript uses the - symbol for subtraction.

    Example

    myVar = 12 - 6;
    myVar would have the value 6.
*/

/* 
    - Change the 0 so the difference is 12.
*/

/* 
    - The variable difference should be equal to 12.
    - You should only subtract one number from 45.
*/
var difference = 45 - 33;
