/* 
    Constructing Strings with VariablesPassed
    Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. 
    By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

    Example:

    var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
    var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
    ourStr would have a value of the string Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?.
*/

/* 
    - Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings My name is and and I am well!
*/

/* 
    - myName should be set to a string at least 3 characters long.
    - You should use two + operators to build myStr with myName inside it.
*/

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "John";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
